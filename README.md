# Portfolio Website - Udacity Project

**Sumary:**

This is my third project that I've done during the [Web Front-End Foundations Nanodegree Program at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). Where I had to build a reponsive Portfolio webpage from a mockup using what I have learned in classes.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS
* Flexbox Grid
* Font Awesome

**Testing**
* Donload the Project to your computer.
* Right click in the index.html filme to open with a browser.

**Closing:**

This project helped me learn a lot about HTML, CSS, Flexbox Grid and more. Showed me how important is the build a responsive web page. I believe that I learned a lot so far, but yet it is always good to keep studing to learn new features and keep myself up to date.
